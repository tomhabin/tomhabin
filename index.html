<h1> Tom Habin </h1>

<p> This is a new website created by yours truly. I hope this will provide you with a bit of information  about me </p>

<p> I am born in Leeds, United Kingdom but I have just moved to Northampton. This is because I have started my first professional role as a KYC analyst in Barclay's Anti-Money Laundering department.</p>

<p> I studied at the University of Nottingham where I received a Master's degree in Mathematics. I graduated last summer in 2023.</p>

<p> Some of my personal interests include cooking - I have a love for Asian cuisine. I also am a passionate DJ and I have my own radio show on the London-based radio station Subtle Radio.</p>
